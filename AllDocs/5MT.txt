Design of carbohydrate multiarrays
Abstract
Recently, microarray technology has increasingly been widely applied in glycobiology. This technology has rather evident potential advantages: unlimited number of carbohydrate ligands coated onto one small sized chip, enormously low consumption of both carbohydrate ligands and carbohydrate-binding proteins to be tested, etc. Literature data demonstrate that three approaches are used for glycoarray design. The first one is based on the physical adsorption of glycomolecules on a surface (as in a common ELISA), the second one—on covalent immobilization, and the third one—on a streptavidin–biotin system. In all of the described methods, carbohydrate ligands were placed on chips as a 2D monolayer and high sensitivity was achieved due to fluorescent detection. Notably, a tendency of stepping from model chips toward real multiarrays, where the number of carbohydrate ligands can be up to two hundred, has been observed the last 2 years, this already producing a number of interesting findings when studying carbohydrate-binding proteins.

In 2005 new construction, 3D glycochip was described, where 150 µm diameter polyacrylamide gel elements serve as microreactors instead of 2D dots. As a result of the 3D placement of a ligand, two orders of magnitude increase of its density is possible, this providing principal signal improvement during fluorescent detection and increasing method sensitivity. At the same time, carbohydrate consumption is low, i.e., ~1 pmol per gel element. Copolymerization chemistry enables the immobilization of several glycomolecule classes to the gel, in particular, aminospacered oligosaccharides, polyacrylamide conjugates, and even 2-aminopyridine derivatives of oligosaccharides, which are widely used in the structural analysis of glycoprotein N-chains.
