CGManalyzer:an R package for analyzing continuous glucose monitoring studies.
Summary: The R package CGManalyzer contains functions for analyzing data from acontinuous glucose monitoring (CGM) study. It covers a wide and comprehensiverange of data analysis methods including reading a series of datasets, obtaining summary statistics of glucose levels, plotting data, transforming the time stamp format, fixing missing values, evaluating the mean of daily difference (MODD) andcontinuous overlapping net glycemic action (CONGA), calculating multiscale sampleentropy (MSE), conducting pairwise comparison, displaying results using variousplots including a new type of plot called an antenna plot, etc. This package has been developed from our work in directly analyzing data from various CGM devices such as the FreeStyle Libre, Glutalor, Dexcom, and Medtronic CGM. Thus, thispackage should greatly facilitate the analysis of various CGM studies.
Availability: The package for Windows is available from CRAN:http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html. The source file CGManalyzer_1.0.tar.gz isavailable at Bioinformatics online and the website of Zhang's labhttp://quantitativelabfhsdev.pclan.umac.mo/analytic-tool/.
