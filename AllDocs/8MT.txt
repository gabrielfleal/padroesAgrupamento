Galectin-3 in macrophage-like cells exposed to immunomodulatory drugs
Abstract
During the last few decades, the effects of immunomodulatory drugs on numerous molecules and biological processes have been widely studied. Nevertheless, the relationship between immunomodulatory drugs and lectin expression/function is still to be elucidated. In this study, we used THP-1-derived macrophages to investigate the effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aspirin and indomethacin) and glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and dexamethasone) on galectin-3, a multifunctional ß-galactoside binding lectin, which in general acts as a strong pro-inflammatory signal. The results showed that all immunomodulatory drugs applied in clinically relevant doses affect both the gene (LGALS3) and protein expression level of galectin-3. The provoked changes on protein level are qualitatively and quantitatively different comparing to the effects on galectin-3 mRNA level, and depend on the differentiation state of the cell, drug type and applied concentration as well as on time of the exposure. Our data revealed galectin-3 as a new target molecule of immunomodulatory drugs, thus suggesting an additional pathway of their action on immune response.
