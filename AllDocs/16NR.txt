Toppar: An interactive browser for viewing association study results.
Summary: Data integration and visualization help geneticists make sense of large amounts of data. To help facilitate interpretation of genetic association data wedeveloped Toppar, a customizable visualization tool that stores results fromassociation studies and enables browsing over multiple results, by combiningfeatures from existing tools and linking to appropriate external databases.Availability: Detailed information on Toppar's features and functionality are on our website http://mccarthy.well.ox.ac.uk/toppar/docs along with instructions on how to download, install and run Toppar.
