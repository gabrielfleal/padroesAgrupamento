Better or Worse? Despite Progress, Many Africans Still Finds It Difficult in Accessing Health Care: A Comparative Analysis of Eight African Countries

Abstract
Citizens’ perceptions in this analysis suggest a number of barriers to health-care access and utilization across the eight African countries studied. On average across 8 countries, Afrobarometer fieldworkers found health clinics in 60% of all survey enumeration areas (EAs). Almost half (17%) of the surveyed countries say they or a family member had to go without medicine or medical care at least once in the year preceding the survey. Among those who accessed health care during the previous year, (31%) found it “difficult” or “very difficult” to get the care they needed. Across the 8 countries, close to half (46%) of citizens say their government is performing “fairly badly” or “very badly” in improving basic health services. In all the 8 countries, only 10% of the citizens say their government is performing very well. In all the 8 countries tracked since 2005, negative evaluations of their governments have increased by 13 percentage points over the past decade. Governments in the African region therefore needs to enhance their efforts to promote accessibility to basic health care services which is a fundamental human right enshrined in the Alma-Ata Declaration.
