SparseIso: a novel Bayesian approach to identify alternatively spliced isoformsfrom RNA-seq data.
Motivation: Recent advances in high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)technologies have made it possible to reconstruct the full transcriptome ofvarious types of cells. It is important to accurately assemble transcripts oridentify isoforms for an improved understanding of molecular mechanisms inbiological systems.
Results: We have developed a novel Bayesian method, SparseIso, to reliablyidentify spliced isoforms from RNA-seq data. A spike-and-slab prior isincorporated into the Bayesian model to enforce the sparsity for isoformidentification, effectively alleviating the problem of overfitting. A Gibbssampling procedure is further developed to simultaneously identify and quantifytranscripts from RNA-seq data. With the sampling approach, SparseIso estimatesthe joint distribution of all candidate transcripts, resulting in a significantlyimproved performance in detecting lowly expressed transcripts and multipleexpressed isoforms of genes. Both simulation study and real data analysis havedemonstrated that the proposed SparseIso method significantly outperformsexisting methods for improved transcript assembly and isoform identification.
