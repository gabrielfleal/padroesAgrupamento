QUENTIN: reconstruction of disease transmissions from viral quasispecies genomic data.
Motivation: Genomic analysis has become one of the major tools for diseaseoutbreak investigations. However, existing computational frameworks for inferenceof transmission history from viral genomic data often do not consider intra-host diversity of pathogens and heavily rely on additional epidemiological data, such as sampling times and exposure intervals. This impedes genomic analysis ofoutbreaks of highly mutable viruses associated with chronic infections, such ashuman immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus, whose transmissions are oftencarried out through minor intra-host variants, while the additionalepidemiological information often is either unavailable or has a limited use.
Results: The proposed framework QUasispecies Evolution, Network-basedTransmission INference (QUENTIN) addresses the above challenges by evolutionaryanalysis of intra-host viral populations sampled by deep sequencing and Bayesian inference using general properties of social networks relevant to infectiondissemination. This method allows inference of transmission direction evenwithout the supporting case-specific epidemiological information, identifytransmission clusters and reconstruct transmission history. QUENTIN was validatedon experimental and simulated data, and applied to investigate HCV transmissionwithin a community of hosts with high-risk behavior.
