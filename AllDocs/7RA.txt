Virtual Reality Programs Applications in Healthcare

Abstract
Current Virtual Reality (VR) applications in healthcare demonstrate potential abilities to address cognitive, psychological, motor, functional impairments and opportunities for training and education of clinical practitioners. Bearing in mind the overall wellness of their communities, healthcare officials had supported the idea of incorporating modern technology by increasing the budget shares and arranging for an access to advanced equipment and professional expertise. Clinicians are becoming more interested in applying VR simulation into their research and clinical trials because of the encouraging feedback published in the medical literature across a wide range of clinical health conditions. Numerous published articles propose novel concepts on applications VR technologies and their potential on disease prevention and management. Finally, the ability of sharing data collected by VR simulation systems through communication networks and electronic health records make it more attractive for the reason that it plays a role in decision making for specific case studies and distance learning.
