A benchmark study of scoring methods for non-coding mutations.Motivation: Detailed knowledge of coding sequences has led to different candidatemodels for pathogenic variant prioritization. Several deleteriousness scores havebeen proposed for the non-coding part of the genome, but no large-scalecomparison has been realized to date to assess their performance.
Results: We compared the leading scoring tools (CADD, FATHMM-MKL, Funseq2 andGWAVA) and some recent competitors (DANN, SNP and SOM scores) for their abilityto discriminate assumed pathogenic variants from assumed benign variants (usingthe ClinVar, COSMIC and 1000 genomes project databases). Using the ClinVarbenchmark, CADD was the best tool for detecting the pathogenic variants that are mainly located in protein coding gene regions. Using the COSMIC benchmark,FATHMM-MKL, GWAVA and SOMliver outperformed the other tools for pathogenicvariants that are typically located in lincRNAs, pseudogenes, and other parts of the non-coding genome. However, all tools had low precision, which couldpotentially be improved by future non-coding genome feature discoveries. These results may have been influenced by the presence of potential benign variants in the COSMIC database. The development of a gold standard as consistent as ClinVar for these regions will be necessary to confirm our tool ranking.Availability and Implementation:The Snakemake, C?++ and R codes are freelyavailable from https://github.com/Oncostat/BenchmarkNCVTools and supported onLinux.
