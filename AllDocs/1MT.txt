Applied glycoproteomics—approaches to study genetic-environmental collisions causing protein-losing enteropathy
Abstract
Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), the loss of plasma proteins through the intestine, is a life-threatening symptom associated with seemingly unrelated conditions including Crohn's disease, congenital disorder of glycosylation, or Fontan surgery to correct univentricular hearts. Emerging commonalities between these and other disorders led us to hypothesize that PLE develops when genetic insufficiencies collide with simultaneous or sequential environmental insults. Most intriguing is the loss of heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans (HSPG) specifically from the basolateral surface of intestinal epithelial cells only during PLE episodes suggesting a direct link to protein leakage. Reasons for HSPG loss are unknown, but genetic insufficiencies affecting HSPG biosynthesis, trafficking, or degradation may be involved. Here, we describe cell-based assays we devised to identify key players contributing to protein leakage. Results from these assays confirm that HS loss directly causes protein leakage, but more importantly, it amplifies the effects of other factors, e.g., cytokines and increased pressure. Thus, HS loss appears to play a central role for PLE. To transfer our in vitro results back to the in vivo situation, we established methods to assess enteric protein leakage in mice and present several genetically deficient strains mimicking intestinal HS loss observed in PLE patients. Preliminary results indicate that mice with haploinsufficient genes involved in HS biosynthesis or HSPG trafficking develop intestinal protein leakage upon additional environmental stress. Our goal is to model PLE in vitro and in vivo to unravel the pathomechanisms underlying PLE, identify patients at risk, and provide them with a safe and effective therapy.
