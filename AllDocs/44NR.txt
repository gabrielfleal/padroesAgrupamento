tmVar 2.0: integrating genomic variant information from literature with dbSNP andClinVar for precision medicine.
Motivation: Despite significant efforts in expert curation, clinical relevanceabout most of the 154 million dbSNP reference variants (RS) remains unknown.However, a wealth of knowledge about the variant biological function/diseaseimpact is buried in unstructured literature data. Previous studies have attemptedto harvest and unlock such information with text-mining techniques but are oflimited use because their mutation extraction results are not standardized orintegrated with curated data.
Results: We propose an automatic method to extract and normalize variant mentionsto unique identifiers (dbSNP RSIDs). Our method, in benchmarking results, demonstrates a high F-measure of ~90% and compared favorably to the state of the art. Next, we applied our approach to the entire PubMed and validated the results by verifying that each extracted variant-gene pair matched the dbSNP annotationbased on mapped genomic position, and by analyzing variants curated in ClinVar.We then determined which text-mined variants and genes constituted noveldiscoveries. Our analysis reveals 41?889 RS numbers (associated with 9151 genes) not found in ClinVar. Moreover, we obtained a rich set worth further review:12?462 rare variants (MAF?=?0.01) in 3849 genes which are presumed to bedeleterious and not frequently found in the general population. To our knowledge,this is the first large-scale study to analyze and integrate text-mined variantdata with curated knowledge in existing databases. Our results suggest thatdatabases can be significantly enriched by text mining and that the combinedinformation can greatly assist human efforts in evaluating/prioritizing variants in genomic research.
