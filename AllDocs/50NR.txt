Orthologue chemical space and its influence on target prediction.
Motivation: In silico approaches often fail to utilize bioactivity data availablefor orthologous targets due to insufficient evidence highlighting the benefit forsuch an approach. Deeper investigation into orthologue chemical space and itsinfluence toward expanding compound and target coverage is necessary to improvethe confidence in this practice.
Results: Here we present analysis of the orthologue chemical space in ChEMBL and PubChem and its impact on target prediction. We highlight the number ofconflicting bioactivities between human and orthologues is low and annotationsare overall compatible. Chemical space analysis shows orthologues are chemically dissimilar to human with high intra-group similarity, suggesting they couldeffectively extend the chemical space modelled. Based on these observations, weshow the benefit of orthologue inclusion in terms of novel target coverage. Wealso benchmarked predictive models using a time-series split and also usingbioactivities from Chemistry Connect and HTS data available at AstraZeneca, showing that orthologue bioactivity inclusion statistically improved performance.
