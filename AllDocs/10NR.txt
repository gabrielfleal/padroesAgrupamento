LeNup: Learning Nucleosome positioning from DNA sequences with improvedconvolutional neural networks.
Motivation: Nucleosome positioning plays significant roles in proper genomepacking and its accessibility to execute transcription regulation. Despite amultitude of nucleosome positioning resources available on line includingexperimental datasets of genome-wide nucleosome occupancy profiles andcomputational tools to the analysis on these data, the complex language ofeukaryotic Nucleosome positioning remains incompletely understood.Results: Here, we address this challenge using an approach based on astate-of-the-art machine learning method. We present a novel convolutional neuralnetwork (CNN) to understand nucleosome positioning. We combined Inception-likenetworks with a gating mechanism for the response of multiple patterns and longterm association in DNA sequences. We developed the open-source package LeNupbased on the CNN to predict nucleosome positioning in Homo sapiens,Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster as well as Saccharomycescerevisiae genomes. We trained LeNup on four benchmark datasets. LeNup achievedgreater predictive accuracy than previously published methods.Availability: LeNup is freely available as Python and Lua script source codeunder a BSD style license from https://github.com/biomedBit/LeNup.
