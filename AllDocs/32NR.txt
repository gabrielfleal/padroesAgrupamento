CSAR: a contig scaffolding tool using algebraic rearrangements.
Summary: Advances in next generation sequencing have generated massive amounts ofshort reads. However, assembling genome sequences from short reads still remains a challenging task. Due to errors in reads and large repeats in the genome, many of current assembly tools usually produce just collections of contigs whoserelative positions and orientations along the genome being sequenced are stillunknown. To address this issue, a scaffolding process to order and orient thecontigs of a draft genome is needed for completing the genome sequence. In thiswork, we propose a new scaffolding tool called CSAR that can efficiently and moreaccurately order and orient the contigs of a given draft genome based on areference genome of a related organism. In particular, the reference genomerequired by CSAR is not necessary to be complete in sequence. Our experimental results on real datasets have shown that CSAR outperforms other similar toolssuch as Projector2, OSLay and Mauve Aligner in terms of average sensitivity,precision, F-score, genome coverage, NGA50 and running time.Availability and implementation: The program of CSAR can be downloaded fromhttps://github.com/ablab-nthu/CSAR.
