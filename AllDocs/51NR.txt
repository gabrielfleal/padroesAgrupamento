Summary: The R package biospear allows selecting the biomarkers with thestrongest impact on survival and on the treatment effect in high-dimensional Cox models, and estimating expected survival probabilities. Most of the implementedapproaches are based on penalized regression techniques.
Availability and implementation: The package is available on the CRAN.(https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=biospear).
