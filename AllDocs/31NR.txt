Mobi 2.0: an improved method to define intrinsic disorder, mobility and linearbinding regions in protein structures.
Motivation: The structures contained in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database are of paramount importance to define our knowledge of folded proteins. Whileproviding mainly circumstantial evidence, PDB data is also increasingly used todefine the lack of unique structure, represented by mobile regions and evenintrinsic disorder (ID). However, alternative definitions are used by differentauthors and potentially limit the generality of the analyses being carried out.
Results: Here we present Mobi 2.0, a completely re-written version of the Mobisoftware for the determination of mobile and potentially disordered regions from PDB structures. Mobi 2.0 provides robust definitions of mobility based on fourmain sources of information: (i) missing residues, (ii) residues with hightemperature factors, (iii) mobility between different models of the samestructure and (iv) binding to another protein or nucleotide chain. Mobi 2.0 iswell suited to aggregate information across different PDB structures for the sameUniProt protein sequence, providing consensus annotations. The software isexpected to standardize the treatment of mobility, allowing an easier comparison across different studies related to ID.Availability: Mobi 2.0 provides the structure-based annotation for the MobiDBdatabase. The software is available from URL http://protein.bio.unipd.it/mobi2/.
