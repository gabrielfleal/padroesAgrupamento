Tumor purity quantification by clonal DNA methylation signatures.
Motivation: Controlling for tumor purity in molecular analyses is essential toallow for reliable genomic aberration calls, for inter-sample comparison and tomonitor heterogeneity of cancer cell populations. In genome wide screeningstudies, the assessment of tumor purity is typically performed by means ofcomputational methods that exploit somatic copy number aberrations (SCNAs).
Results: We present a strategy, called PAMES (Purity Assessment from clonalMEthylation Sites), which uses the methylation level of a few dozen, highlyclonal, tumor type specific CpG sites to estimate the purity of tumor samples,without the need of a matched benign control. We trained and validated our methodin more than 6,000 samples from different datasets. Purity estimates by PAMESwere highly concordant with other state-of-the-art tools and its evaluation in a cancer cell line dataset highlights its reliability to accurately estimate tumor admixtures.We extended the capability of PAMES to the analysis of CpG islandsinstead of the more platform-specific CpG sites and demonstrated its accuracy in a set of advanced tumors profiled by high throughput DNA methylation sequencing. These analyses show that PAMES is a valuable tool to assess the purity of tumorsamples in the settings of clinical research and diagnostics.
