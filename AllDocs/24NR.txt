DIMM-SC: a Dirichlet mixture model for clustering droplet-based single celltranscriptomic data.
Motivation: Single cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has become arevolutionary tool to study cellular and molecular processes at single cellresolution. Among existing technologies, the recently developed droplet-basedplatform enables efficient parallel processing of thousands of single cells with direct counting of transcript copies using Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI).Despite the technology advances, statistical methods and computational tools are still lacking for analyzing droplet-based scRNA-Seq data. Particularly,model-based approaches for clustering large-scale single cell transcriptomic dataare still under-explored.
Results: We developed DIMM-SC, a Dirichlet Mixture Model for clusteringdroplet-based Single Cell transcriptomic data. This approach explicitly modelsUMI count data from scRNA-Seq experiments and characterizes variations acrossdifferent cell clusters via a Dirichlet mixture prior. We performed comprehensivesimulations to evaluate DIMM-SC and compared it with existing clustering methods such as K-means, CellTree and Seurat. In addition, we analyzed public scRNA-Seqdatasets with known cluster labels and in-house scRNA-Seq datasets from a studyof systemic sclerosis with prior biological knowledge to benchmark and validateDIMM-SC. Both simulation studies and real data applications demonstrated thatoverall, DIMM-SC achieves substantially improved clustering accuracy and muchlower clustering variability compared to other existing clustering methods. More importantly, as a model-based approach, DIMM-SC is able to quantify theclustering uncertainty for each single cell, facilitating rigorous statisticalinference and biological interpretations, which are typically unavailable fromexisting clustering methods.
Availability and implementation: DIMM-SC has been implemented in a user-friendly R package with a detailed tutorial available onwww.pitt.edu/~wec47/singlecell.html.
