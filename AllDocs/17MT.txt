Tracing the history of Gala1–4Gal on glycoproteins in modern birds
Abstract
Gala1–4Gal is typically found in mammalian glycolipids in small quantities, and recognized by some pathogens, such as uropathogenic Escherichia coli. In contrast, glycoproteins containing Gala1–4Gal were rarely found in vertebrates except in a few species of birds and amphibians until recently. However, we had previously reported that pigeon (Columba livia) egg white and serum glycoproteins are rich in N-glycans with Gala1–4Gal at non-reducing termini. Our investigation with egg white glycoproteins from 181 avian species also revealed that the distribution of (Gala1–4Gal)-containing glycoproteins was not rare among avians, and is correlated with the phylogeny of birds. The differentiated expression was most likely emerged at earlier stage of diversification of modern birds, but some birds might have lost the facility for the expression relatively recently.
