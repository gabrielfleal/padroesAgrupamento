Germ cell depletion from mammalian ovary: possible involvement of apoptosis and autophagy

Abstract
Mammalian ovary contains millions of germ cells during embryonic life but only few of them are culminated into oocytes that achieve meiotic competency just prior to ovulation. The majority of germ cells are depleted from ovary through several pathways. Follicular atresia is one of the major events that eliminate germ cells from ovary by engaging apoptotic as well as non-apoptotic pathways of programmed cell death. Apoptosis is characterized by several morphological changes that include cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, membrane blebbing and cytoplasmic fragmentation by both mitochondria- as well as death receptor-mediated pathways in encircling granulosa cells and oocyte. Although necroapoptosis have been implicated in germ cell depletion, autophagy seems to play an active role in the life and death decisions of ovarian follicles. Autophagy is morphologically characterized by intracellular reorganization of membranes and increased number of autophagic vesicles that engulf bulk cytoplasm as well as organelles. Autophagy begins with the encapsulation of cytoplasmic constituents in a membrane sac known as autophagosomes. The autophagic vesicles are then destroyed by the lysosomal enzymes such as hydrolases that results in follicular atresia. It seems that apoptosis as well as autophagy could play active roles in germ cells depletion from ovary. Hence, it is important to prevent these two pathways in order to retain the germ cells in ovary of several mammalian species that are either threatened or at the verge of extinction. The involvement of apoptosis and autophagy in germ cell depletion from mammalian ovary is reviewed and possible pathways have been proposed.
