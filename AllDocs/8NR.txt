PyChimera: Use UCSF Chimera modules in any Python 2.7 project.
Motivation: UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) is a powerful visualizationtool remarkably present in the computational chemistry and structural biologycommunities. Built on a C?++ core wrapped under a Python 2.7 environment, onecould expect to easily import UCSF Chimera's arsenal of resources in customscripts or software projects. Nonetheless, this is not readily possible if thescript is not executed within UCSF Chimera due to the isolation of the platform. UCSF ChimeraX (Goddard et al., 2017), successor to the original Chimera,partially solves the problem but yet major upgrades need to be undergone so that this updated version can offer all UCSF Chimera features.
Results: PyChimera has been developed to overcome these limitations and provideaccess to the UCSF Chimera codebase from any Python 2.7 interpreter, includinginteractive programming with tools like IPython (Perez and Granger, 2007)andJupyter Notebooks, making it easier to use with additional third-party software.
