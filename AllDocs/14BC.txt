Neurochemical changes in basal ganglia affect time perception in parkinsonians

Abstract
Background
Parkinson’s disease is described as resulting from dopaminergic cells progressive degeneration, specifically in the substantia nigra pars compacta that influence the voluntary movements control, decision making and time perception.

Aim
This review had a goal to update the relation between time perception and Parkinson’s Disease.

Methodology
We used the PRISMA methodology for this investigation built guided for subjects dopaminergic dysfunction in the time judgment, pharmacological models with levodopa and new studies on the time perception in Parkinson’s Disease. We researched on databases Scielo, Pubmed / Medline and ISI Web of Knowledge on August 2017 and repeated in September 2017 and February 2018 using terms and associations relevant for obtaining articles in English about the aspects neurobiology incorporated in time perception. No publication status or restriction of publication date was imposed, but we used as exclusion criteria: dissertations, book reviews, conferences or editorial work.

Results/Discussion
We have demonstrated that the time cognitive processes are underlying to performance in cognitive tasks and that many are the brain areas and functions involved and the modulators in the time perception performance.

Conclusions
The influence of dopaminergic on Parkinson’s Disease is an important research tool in Neuroscience while allowing for the search for clarifications regarding behavioral phenotypes of Parkinson’s disease patients and to study the areas of the brain that are involved in the dopaminergic circuit and their integration with the time perception mechanisms.
