NavMol 3.0: enabling the representation of metabolic reactions by blind users.
Summary: The representation of metabolic reactions strongly relies onvisualization, which is a major barrier for blind users. The NavMol softwarerenders the communication and interpretation of molecular structures andreactions accessible by integrating chemoinformatics and assistive technology.NavMol 3.0 provides a molecular editor for metabolic reactions. The user canstart with templates of reactions and build from such cores. Atom-to-atom mappingenables changes in the reactants to be reflected in the products (and vice-versa)and the reaction centres to be automatically identified. Blind users can easilyinteract with the software using the keyboard and text-to-speech technology. Availability and implementation: NavMol 3.0 is free and open source under the GNUgeneral public license (GPLv3), and can be downloaded at http://sourceforge.net/projects/navmol as a JAR file.
