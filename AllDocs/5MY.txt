John Bryden graduated in medicine at Glasgow University in 1956 and after completing his national service worked in orthopedics and became a GP covering Mosspark and Govan. An early interest in optical character recognition and computer programming led to a three-year fellowship in administrative medicine and a diploma in Social medicine from Edinburgh University.
