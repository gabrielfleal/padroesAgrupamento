A network approach to exploring the functional basis of gene-gene epistaticinteractions in disease susceptibility.
Motivation: Individual genetic variants explain only a small fraction ofheritability in some diseases. Some variants have weak marginal effects ondisease risk, but their joint effects are significantly stronger when occurringtogether. Most studies on such epistatic interactions have focused on methods foridentifying the interactions and interpreting individual cases, but few haveexplored their general functional basis. This was due to the lack of acomprehensive list of epistatic interactions and uncertainties in associatingvariants to genes.
Results: We conducted a large-scale survey of published research articles tocompile the first comprehensive list of epistatic interactions in human diseases with detailed annotations. We used various methods to associate these variants togenes to ensure robustness. We found that these genes are significantly moreconnected in protein interaction networks, are more co-expressed, and participatemore often in the same pathways. We demonstrate using the list to discover novel disease pathways.
