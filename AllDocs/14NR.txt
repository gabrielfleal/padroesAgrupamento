pyHVis3D: Visualising Molecular Simulation deduced H-bond networks in 3D:Application to T-cell receptor interactions.
Motivation: Hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) play an essential role for many molecularinteractions but are also often transient, making visualizing them in a flexible system challenging.
Results: We provide pyHVis3D which allows for an easy to interpret 3Dvisualisation of H-bonds resulting from molecular simulations. We demonstrate thepower of pyHVis3D by using it to explain the changes in experimentally measuredbinding affinities for three T-cell receptor/peptide/MHC complexes and mutants ofeach of these complexes.
