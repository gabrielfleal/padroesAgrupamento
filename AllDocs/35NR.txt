LightDock: a new multi-scale approach to protein-protein docking.
Motivation: Computational prediction of protein-protein complex structure bydocking can provide structural and mechanistic insights for protein interactions of biomedical interest. However, current methods struggle with difficult cases,such as those involving flexible proteins, low-affinity complexes or transientinteractions. A major challenge is how to efficiently sample the structural andenergetic landscape of the association at different resolution levels, given thateach scoring function is often highly coupled to a specific type of searchmethod. Thus, new methodologies capable of accommodating multi-scaleconformational flexibility and scoring are strongly needed.
Results: We describe here a new multi-scale protein-protein docking methodology, LightDock, capable of accommodating conformational flexibility and a variety ofscoring functions at different resolution levels. Implicit use of normal modesduring the search and atomic/coarse-grained combined scoring functions yieldedimproved predictive results with respect to state-of-the-art rigid-body docking, especially in flexible cases.Availability and implementation: The source code of the software and installationinstructions are available for download at https://life.bsc.es/pid/lightdock/.
