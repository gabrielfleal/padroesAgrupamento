Three-dimensional cardiovascular imaging-genetics: a mass univariate framework.
Motivation: Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is a strong predictor ofcardiovascular outcomes, but its genetic regulation remains largely unexplained. Conventional phenotyping relies on manual calculation of LV mass and wallthickness, but advanced cardiac image analysis presents an opportunity forhigh-throughput mapping of genotype-phenotype associations in three dimensions(3D).
Results: High-resolution cardiac magnetic resonance images were automaticallysegmented in 1124 healthy volunteers to create a 3D shape model of the heart.Mass univariate regression was used to plot a 3D effect-size map for theassociation between wall thickness and a set of predictors at each vertex in the mesh. The vertices where a significant effect exists were determined by applying threshold-free cluster enhancement to boost areas of signal with spatialcontiguity. Experiments on simulated phenotypic signals and SNP replication show that this approach offers a substantial gain in statistical power for cardiacgenotype-phenotype associations while providing good control of the falsediscovery rate. This framework models the effects of genetic variation throughoutthe heart and can be automatically applied to large population cohorts.
Availability and implementation: The proposed approach has been coded in an Rpackage freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.834610 together withthe clinical data used in this work.
