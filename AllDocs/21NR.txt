A novel data structure to support ultra-fast taxonomic classification ofmetagenomic sequences with k-mer signatures.
Motivation: Metagenomic read classification is a critical step in theidentification and quantification of microbial species sampled by high-throughputsequencing. Although many algorithms have been developed to date, they suffersignificant memory and/or computational costs. Due to the growing popularity ofmetagenomic data in both basic science and clinical applications, as well as the increasing volume of data being generated, efficient and accurate algorithms are in high demand.
Results: We introduce MetaOthello, a probabilistic hashing classifier formetagenomic sequencing reads. The algorithm employs a novel data structure,called l-Othello, to support efficient querying of a taxon using its k-mersignatures. MetaOthello is an order-of-magnitude faster than the currentstate-of-the-art algorithms Kraken and Clark, and requires nly one-third of the RAM. In comparison to Kaiju, a metagenomic classification tool using proteinsequences instead of genomic sequences, MetaOthello is three times faster andexhibits 20-30% higher classification sensitivity. We report comparative analysesof both scalability and accuracy using a number of simulated and empiricaldatasets.Availability and implementation: MetaOthello is a stand-alone program implementedin C?++. The current version (1.0) is accessible viahttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.808941.
