A Rapid Epistatic Mixed-model Association Analysis by Linear Retransformations of Genomic Estimated Values.
Motivation: Epistasis provides a feasible way for probing potential geneticmechanism of complex traits. However, imeconsuming computation challengessuccessful detection of interaction in practice, especially when linear mixedmodel (LMM) is used to control type I error in the presence of populationstructure and cryptic relatedness.
Results: A rapid epistatic mixed-model association analysis (REMMA) method wasdeveloped to overcome computational limitation. This method first estimatesindividuals' epistatic effects by an extended genomic best linear unbiasedprediction (EG-BLUP) model with additive and epistatic kinship matrix, thenpairwise interaction effects are obtained by linear retransformations ofindividuals' epistatic effects. Simulation studies showed that REMMA couldcontrol type I error and increase statistical power in detecting epistatic QTNsin comparison with existing LMM-based FaST-LMM. We applied REMMA to two realdatasets, a mouse dataset and the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium(WTCCC) data. Application to the mouse data further confirmed the performance of REMMA incontrolling type I error. For the WTCCC data, we found most epistatic QTNs fortype 1 diabetes (T1D) located in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region,from which a large interacting network with 12 hub genes (interacting with ten ormore genes) was established.Availability and Implementation: Our REMMA method can be freely accessed athttps://github.com/chaoning/REMMA.
