Dissatisfactions that Leads to Least Online Rating of Hospitals by its Customers

Abstract
Word of mouth publicity has been casting substantial impact on hospital’s business. This has become even more impactful with increasing use of online rating and reviews. A lower average rating can potentially affect the hospital’s business negatively. Average rating gets considerably lowered with customers giving least rating to a hospital. This study attempts at identifying components that leads a customer to give least rating to a hospital. The study analyses 669 descriptive reviews accompanying a rating by qualitatively analysing and grouping them in component of dissatisfactions (CoD). Each CoD was then tested for their association with least online rating to identify significant ones. Out of 5 CoD, 3 were found significant (Medical Care, Conduct and Money making attitude) while remaining 2 were not (System and facilities and Expensiveness). Amongst CoD that were found significant, no significant difference was found in between them in their strength of association with least online rating.
