An automated tool for obtaining QSAR-ready series of compounds using semantic webtechnologies.
Summary: We describe an application (Collector) for obtaining series of compoundsannotated with bioactivity data, ready to be used for the development ofquantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) models. The tool extractsdata from the 'Open Pharmacological Space' (OPS) developed by the Open PHACTSproject, using as input a valid name of the biological target. Collector uses theOPS ontologies for expanding the query using all known target synonyms andextracts compounds with bioactivity data against the target from multiplesources. The extracted data can be filtered to retain only drug-like compoundsand the bioactivities can be automatically summarised to assign a single valueper compound, yielding data ready to be used for QSAR modeling. The data obtainedis locally stored facilitating the traceability and auditability of the process. Collector was used successfully for the development of models for toxicityendpoints within the eTOX project.Availability and implementation: The software is available athttp://phi.upf.edu/collector. The source code is located athttps://github.com/phi-grib/Collector and is free for use under the GPL3 license.The web version is hosted at http://collector.upf.edu/.
