Novel approaches for bioinformatic analysis of salivary RNA sequencing data fordevelopment.
Motivation: Analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data in human saliva ischallenging. Lack of standardization and unification of the bioinformaticprocedures undermines saliva's diagnostic potential. Thus, it motivated us toperform this study.
Results: We applied principal pipelines for bioinformatic analysis of smallRNA-Seq data of saliva of 98 healthy Korean volunteers including either direct orindirect mapping of the reads to the human genome using Bowtie1. Analysis ofalignments to exogenous genomes by another pipeline revealed that almost all ofthe reads map to bacterial genomes. Thus, salivary exRNA has fundamentalproperties that warrant the design of unique additional steps while performing the bioinformatic analysis. Our pipelines can serve as potential guidelines forprocessing of RNA-Seq data of human saliva.
Availability and implementation: Processing and analysis results of theexperimental data generated by the exceRpt (v4.6.3) small RNA-seq pipeline(github.gersteinlab.org/exceRpt) are available from exRNA atlas(exrna-atlas.org). Alignment to exogenous genomes and their quantification results were used in this paper for the analyses f small RNAs of exogenousorigin.
