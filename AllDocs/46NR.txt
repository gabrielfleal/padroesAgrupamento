ReMILO: reference assisted misassembly detection algorithm using short and longreads.
Motivation: Contigs assembled from the second generation sequencing short readsmay contain misassemblies, and thus complicate downstream analysis or even leadto incorrect analysis results. Fortunately, with more and more sequenced species available, it becomes possible to use the reference genome of a closely relatedspecies to detect misassemblies. In addition, long reads of the third generation sequencing technology have been more and more widely used, and can also helpdetect misassemblies.
Results: Here, we introduce ReMILO, a reference assisted misassembly detectionalgorithm that uses both short reads and PacBio SMRT long reads. ReMILO alignsthe initial short reads to both the contigs and reference genome, and thenconstructs a novel data structure called red-black multipositional de Bruijngraph to detect misassemblies. In addition, ReMILO also aligns the contigs tolong reads and find their differences from the long reads to detect moremisassemblies. In our performance test on short read assemblies of humanchromosome 14 data, ReMILO can detect 41.8-77.9% extensive misassemblies and33.6-54.5% local misassemblies. On hybrid short and long read assemblies ofS.pastorianus data, ReMILO can also detect 60.6-70.9% extensive misassemblies and28.6-54.0% local misassemblies.
