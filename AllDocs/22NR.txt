A nonparametric significance test for sampled networks.
Motivation: Our work is motivated by an interest in constructing aprotein-protein interaction network that captures key features associated withParkinson's disease. While there is an abundance of subnetwork constructionmethods available, it is often far from obvious which subnetwork is the mostsuitable starting point for further investigation.
Results: We provide a method to assess whether a subnetwork constructed from aseed list (a list of nodes known to be important in the area of interest) differssignificantly from a randomly generated subnetwork. The proposed method uses aMonte Carlo approach. As different seed lists can give rise to the samesubnetwork, we control for redundancy by constructing a minimal seed list as the starting point for the significance test. The null model is based on random seed lists of the same length as a minimum seed list that generates the subnetwork; inthis random seed list the nodes have (approximately) the same degree distributionas the nodes in the minimum seed list. We use this null model to selectsubnetworks which deviate significantly from random on an appropriate set ofstatistics and might capture useful information for a real world protein-protein interaction network.
