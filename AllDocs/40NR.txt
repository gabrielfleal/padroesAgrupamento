Morphologically constrained and data informed cell segmentation of budding yeast.
Motivation: Although high-content image cytometry is becoming increasinglyroutine, processing the large amount of data acquired during time-lapseexperiments remains a challenge. The majority of approaches for automatedsingle-cell segmentation focus on flat, uniform fields of view covered with asingle layer of cells. In the increasingly popular microfluidic devices that trapindividual cells for long term imaging, these conditions are not met.Consequently, most techniques for segmentation perform poorly. Althoughpotentially constraining the generalizability of software, incorporatinginformation about the microfluidic features, flow of media and the morphology of the cells can substantially improve performance.
Results: Here we present DISCO (Data Informed Segmentation of Cell Objects), aframework for using the physical constraints imposed by microfluidic traps, theshape based morphological constraints of budding yeast and temporal informationabout cell growth and motion to allow tracking and segmentation of cells inmicrofluidic devices. Using manually curated datasets, we demonstrate substantialimprovements in both tracking and segmentation when compared with existingsoftware.
Availability and implementation: The MATLAB code for the algorithm and formeasuring performance is available athttps://github.com/pswain/segmentation-software and the test images and thecurated ground-truth results used for comparing the algorithms are available at http://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2002.
