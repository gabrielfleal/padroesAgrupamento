Deconvolution of multiple infections in Plasmodium falciparum from highthroughput sequencing data.
Motivation: The presence of multiple infecting strains of the malarial parasitePlasmodium falciparum affects key phenotypic traits, including drug resistanceand risk of severe disease. Advances in protocols and sequencing technology have made it possible to obtain high-coverage genome-wide sequencing data from bloodsamples and blood spots taken in the field. However, analyzing and interpretingsuch data is challenging because of the high rate of multiple infections present.
Results: We have developed a statistical method and implementation fordeconvolving multiple genome sequences present in an individual with mixedinfections. The software package DEploid uses haplotype structure within areference panel of clonal isolates as a prior for haplotypes present in a givensample. It estimates the number of strains, their relative proportions and thehaplotypes presented in a sample, allowing researchers to study multipleinfection in malaria with an unprecedented level of detail.
Availability and implementation: The open source implementation DEploid is freelyavailable at https://github.com/mcveanlab/DEploid under the conditions of theGPLv3 license. An R version is available at https://github.com/mcveanlab/DEploid-r.
