Interactive network visualization in Jupyter notebooks: visJS2jupyter.
Motivation: Network biology is widely used to elucidate mechanisms of disease andbiological processes. The ability to interact with biological networks isimportant for hypothesis generation and to give researchers an intuitive understanding of the data. We present visJS2jupyter, a tool designed to embedinteractive networks in Jupyter notebooks to streamline network analysis and topromote reproducible research.
Results: The tool provides functions for performing and visualizing usefulnetwork operations in biology, including network overlap, network propagationaround a focal set of genes, and co-localization of two sets of seed genes.visJS2jupyter uses the JavaScript library vis.js to create interactive networksdisplayed within Jupyter notebook cells with features including drag, click,hover, and zoom. We demonstrate the functionality of visJS2jupyter applied to abiological question, by creating a network propagation visualization toprioritize risk-related genes in autism.Availability and implementation: The visJS2jupyter package is distributed under the MIT License.
