PEATH: Single Individual Haplotyping by a Probabilistic Evolutionary Algorithm with Toggling.
Motivation: Single individual haplotyping (SIH) is critical in genomicassociation studies and genetic diseases analysis. However, most genomic analysisstudies do not perform haplotype-phasing analysis due to its complexity. Several computational methods have been developed to solve the SIH problem, but theseapproaches have not generated sufficiently reliable haplotypes.
Results: Here, we propose a novel SIH algorithm, called PEATH (ProbabilisticEvolutionary Algorithm with Toggling for Haplotyping), to achieve more accurateand reliable haplotyping. The proposed PEATH method was compared to the mostrecent algorithms in terms of the phased length, N50 length, switch error rate,and minimum error correction. The PEATH algorithm consistently provides the best phase and N50 lengths, as long as possible, given datasets. In addition,verification of the simulation data demonstrated that the PEATH methodoutperforms other methods on high noisy data. Additionally, the experimentalresults of a real dataset confirmed that the PEATH method achieved comparable or better accuracy.
