Kfits: a software framework for fitting and cleaning outliers in kineticmeasurements.
Motivation: Kinetic measurements have played an important role in elucidatingbiochemical and biophysical phenomena for over a century. While many tools foranalysing kinetic measurements exist, most require low noise levels in the data, leaving outlier measurements to be cleaned manually. This is particularly truefor protein misfolding and aggregation processes, which are extremely noisy andhence difficult to model. Understanding these processes is paramount, as they areassociated with diverse physiological processes and disorders, most notablyneurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, a better tool for analysing and cleaningprotein aggregation traces is required.
Results: Here we introduce Kfits, an intuitive graphical tool for detecting andremoving noise caused by outliers in protein aggregation kinetics data. Followingits workflow allows the user to quickly and easily clean large quantities of dataand receive kinetic parameters for assessment of the results. With minoradjustments, the software can be applied to any type of kinetic measurements, notrestricted to protein aggregation.Availability and implementation: Kfits is implemented in Python and availableonline at http://kfits.reichmannlab.com, in source at https://github.com/odedrim/kfits/, or by direct installation from PyPI (`pipinstall kfits`).
