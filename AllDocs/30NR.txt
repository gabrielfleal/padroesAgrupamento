iPromoter-2L: a two-layer predictor for identifying promoters and their types by multi-window-based PseKNC.
Motivation: Being responsible for initiating transaction of a particular gene in genome, promoter is a short region of DNA. Promoters have various types withdifferent functions. Owing to their importance in biological process, it ishighly desired to develop computational tools for timely identifying promotersand their types. Such a challenge has become particularly critical and urgent in facing the avalanche of DNA sequences discovered in the postgenomic age. Althoughsome prediction methods were developed, they can only be used to discriminate aspecific type of promoters from non-promoters. None of them has the ability toidentify the types of promoters. This is due to the facts that different types ofpromoters may share quite similar consensus sequence pattern, and that thepromoters of same type may have considerably different consensus sequences.
Results: To overcome such difficulty, using the multi-window-based PseKNC (pseudoK-tuple nucleotide composition) approach to incorporate the short-, middle-, and long-range sequence information, we have developed a two-layer seamless predictornamed as 'iPromoter-2?L'. The first layer serves to identify a query DNA sequenceas a promoter or non-promoter, and the second layer to predict which of thefollowing six types the identified promoter belongs to: s24, s28, s32, s38, s54and s70.Availability and implementation: For the convenience of most experimentalscientists, a user-friendly and publicly accessible web-server for the powerfulnew predictor has been established athttp://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iPromoter-2L/. It is anticipated thatiPromoter-2?L will become a very useful high throughput tool for genome analysis.
