An accurate algorithm for the detection of DNA fragments from dilution poolsequencing experiments.
Motivation: The short read lengths of current high-throughput sequencingtechnologies limit the ability to recover long-range haplotype information.Dilution pool methods for preparing DNA sequencing libraries from high molecular weight DNA fragments enable the recovery of long DNA fragments from shortsequence reads. These approaches require computational methods for identifyingthe DNA fragments using aligned sequence reads and assembling the fragments into long haplotypes. Although a number of computational methods have been developedfor haplotype assembly, the problem of identifying DNA fragments from dilutionpool sequence data has not received much attention.
Results: We formulate the problem of detecting DNA fragments from dilution poolsequencing experiments as a genome segmentation problem and develop an algorithm that uses dynamic programming to optimize a likelihood function derived from agenerative model for the sequence reads. This algorithm uses an iterativeapproach to automatically infer the mean background read depth and the number of fragments in each pool. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that our method,FragmentCut, has 25-30% greater sensitivity compared with an HMM based method forfragment detection and can also detect overlapping fragments. On a whole-genomehuman fosmid pool dataset, the haplotypes assembled using the fragmentsidentified by FragmentCut had greater N50 length, 16.2% lower switch error rateand 35.8% lower mismatch error rate compared with two existing methods. Wefurther demonstrate the greater accuracy of our method using two additionaldilution pool datasets.
