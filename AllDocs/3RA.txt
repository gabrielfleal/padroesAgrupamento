A Reflection on How We Value our Research (Impacts)…

Abstract
This letter to the editor of Planning Magazine was written in response to an article published in the June 2016 issue of the magazine entitled “Research You Can Use-The five most-cited planning researchers”. To this day the letter has remained unaddressed by the editor. Therefore, I have taken the liberty to submit it to the Journal of Health & Medical Informatics, since some of the so called “most-cited” authors have also published on health-related topics, and the points I make in my letter below are valid across multiple disciplinary fields.
